􏶨􏶧􏶦During a normal reposition, the location/speed are sent to the flight model.
The flight model trims the helicopter to a state of zero accelerations and then returns control positions to f2si for unpausing.
During a Special reposition, the flight model is provided all values of the state, and adjusts to that particular state.􏶥
