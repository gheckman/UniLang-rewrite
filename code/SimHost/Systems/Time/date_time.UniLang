􏷲An adjustable date and a time with millisecond precision􏷱
􏷰A replacement over time_t and struct tm from the standard C library.
Due to the size and precision limitations of time_t and struct tm,
DateTime provides a similar interface to struct tm, but can be updated with millisecond precision.  
It contains both the date month/day/year, and the time of day in milliseconds.
The reason this type was added was to account for the size limitations on 32-bit machine of tm.  
We would not be able to exceed the year 2038 without rolling out our own DateTime object.  
The datetime changes through a millisecond delta, and it handles the overflow of days and months.  
It accounts for leap years, but does not account for daylight savings time or leap seconds.
The year limit of datetime is now the max size of an unsigned int.􏷯
