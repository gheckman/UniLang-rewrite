    􏶲there may be a need to simulate a spike when the generator or battery is turned on.
    I have no information on this, so for the time being, I'll leave a comment only.

    1. Change the state of particular nodes of the graph based on the input data coming in.
       This involves:
       - turning off flow on nodes whose electrical components are signaled to be off.
       - popping circuit breakers
       - opening closing relays
       - applying malfunctions
    
       *These changes may come from other systems, from the IOS, or from the PLC􏶱

    􏶲2. Run algorithm to compute new electrical data among the nodes.􏶱

    􏶲3. Turn off power on all components that are no longer receiving electricity in the graph.􏶱
    􏵲stop power on disconnected components􏵳􏵶dc system􏵷);

    􏶲4. Potentially fudge data to match the documents on what should ACTUALLY be displayed on the screens.
       - Hopefully this does not need to be done if the resistances are set appropriately on each of the nodes.
       - However, I suspect that we might end up checking to see if a node's amperage is between some range, and then set it to an exact value based on that.
         because documents such as the LUH-CUSTOMIZED-REV-11-VOL-1.pdf give exact values down to two decimal places.
         Deriving these perfectly seems unlikely without spending too much time tweaking resistances.􏶱

    􏶲In order to change the state of the power system, we will
    1. Apply malfunctions
    2. Change bus tie relays, and power sources based on physical switch states
    3. Pop any breakers􏶱
