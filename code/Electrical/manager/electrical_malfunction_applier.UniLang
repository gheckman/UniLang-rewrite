    􏶲possibly stop flow on the bus tie 1 (force it to open)
    Q: What if the bus tie is already closed?  Does it stay closed during this malfunction?
    Does the malfunction only stop it from re-closing again in the future?
    A: The SME says that the BusTieFailsOpen will make the bus tie open even if it is already closed.􏶱

    􏶲maybe we'll do something different depending on the level at which its overheating?
    maybe we won't stop flow anywhere until the overheat reaches a certain temperature?
    the description says that the generator does not automatically trip off.
    At least for now, let's just check if it's overheating at all, and if it is, we'll shut off the flow􏶱
