     * B-device is allowed to drive VBUS. So VBUS Pulsing should be a
     * hardware automatically controlled process, software will just
     * need to initiate the SRP (by writing some control bit for example).

     * than the B-Device Session Valid threshold (VB_SESS_VLD), then

     * TB_SVLD_BCON max.
     *
     * OTG 2.0 simply defines VOTG_SESS_VLD (0.8V ~ 4.0V) because the VBUS
     * pulsing method of SRP has been removed.
     *
     * Based on the above descriptions, we will only need to have one
     * unified VBUS state for both "A-Device Session Valid" and "B-Device
     * Session Valid".
     *
     * The OTG Controller Driver is required to report to the OTG Notifier

     * the specified range (VA_VBUS_OUT)(4.4V~5.25V) on that port.

/*
 * USB OTG Event Report Mechanism
 *
 * The USB OTG Manager takes advantages of the erfLib to allow the
 * OTG Controller Driver to report events to the USB OTG Manager.
 *
 * Events such as VBUS state changes (such as at VBUS error interrupt),
 * ID pin state changes (grounded or floated), and SRP being detected, are
 * reported through event handler callbacks from the OTG Controller Driver.
 * These events will be mostly reported in the OCD common ISR, thus
 * the implementation of these notify functions are done using VxWorks
 * erfLib ERF_ASYNC_PROC mode, which performs slightly delayed action 
 * in the tErfTask which is at pretty high priority. The reason for this
 * "delay to high priority task" processing are:
 *
 * 1) All these OTG events will alter some OTG input parameter, however the
 * OTG Manager may also alter these parameters while it works to advance the
 * OTG State Machine, as well as user application adding requests. For this
 * the OTG Manager should be protected from cocurrent updates to the parameters
 * to make consistent OTG State Machine. This means we need to be in task
 * context, and need to take the lock to update the parameters, then release
 * the lock.
 *
 * 2) Most of these OTG related events are bound with strict timing requirement.
 * These events must be reported in high priority for the OTG Manager to respond.
 * If we use normal priority to report these events, we might miss some key
 * timing requirment due to the preemption delay for normal priority tasks.
