/* The IMT Info code contains a 1 byte opcode with optional 
   operands. The lower 3 bits defines the length of the operand,
   so that the byte code can be expanded without making the readers
   outdated.
   All operands are big-endian.

   Calculate the base address of the SDA by adding the DA
   address with CONST. Put this address in the DAT.

   Store the address to the SCA base at the fixed offset
   __SCAbase in the SDA. This address is calculated by adding
   the address of CA with CONST.

   Fill the next IMT entry with the information about the
   external function STRING. This is done as follows:
   - Search all other modules for the name STRING.
   - If found:
    + Fill the first instruction in the IMT entry with a 
      "lwz  r13,__DATbase(r13)" to load the DAT pointer.
    + Fill the second instruction with a "lwz  r13,__DAToffs(r13)",
      where __DAToffs is the module number of the module times four.
    + Fill the third instruction with a "lwz  r2,__SCAbase(r13)"
      to get the SCA pointer.
    + Fill the fourth instruction with a "b  function".
   - If not found:
    + Fill the first instruction with a "b  __IMTfind".
      The __IMTfind will search for the expected function
      (the IMT entry address is still in r12, so the current CA can be scanned
      to get the name of the function), since it might be in a module loaded
      after the current module was loaded. If so, the IMT entry is patched,
      otherwise the system loader is called to either load a new module, or
      to give an error.
   There is one IMTNAME command for each external function.

     "lwz  r13,__DATbase(r13)" to load the DAT pointer.
   + Fill the second instruction with a "lwz  r13,__DAToffs(r13)",
     where __DAToffs is the current module number of the module times four.
   + Fill the third instruction with a "lwz  r2,__SCAbase(r13)"
